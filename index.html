      <h2 class="center">Rice</h2>
      <h3 class="italics center">Entrée</h3>
      <p> Rice is basically a cultural food in my home, if a meal does not have rice in it, its not a meal. Rice goes well with anything really and thats why I like it</p>

      <h2 class="center">Beans</h2>
      <h3 class="italics center">Entrée</h3>
      <p>Beans is also a cultural food in my house. While beans is basically on every meal,I wouldn't mind if I didn't have it. 99% of the times I eat beans, its paired with rice.</p>

      <h2 class="center">Mango Mousse</h2>
      <h3 class="italics center">Dessert</h3>
      <p>Mousse is my favorite dessert because of its texture and taste. We usually make it on Holidays like Christmas.</p>
